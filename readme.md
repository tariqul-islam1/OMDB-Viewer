# OMDB Viewer
A very simple yet powerful app to search through Open Movie Data Base. OMDB uses IMDB for the data but OMDB is free 
and provides simple API.

## Features
Following is a list of what libraries I have used to make this app:
- Uses Android Jetpack, Material Design Guidelines, AndroidX Support libraries and AndroidX testing specifications
- Networking tasks was done by Retrofit, RxJava and Picasso
- Image caching was done by Picasso with OkHttp
- Testing was done using Espresso and Junit
